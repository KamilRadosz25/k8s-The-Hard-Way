Kubernetes The Hard Way

## Project Overview
This project aims to create a minimal Kubernetes cluster using two virtual machines (1 master, 1 worker), fully provisioned via Vagrant.  
The purpose is to manually build and configure the cluster ("Kubernetes the Hard Way") to better understand its internal components, networking, and security mechanisms.

Provisioning of the environment is automated using Vagrant and shell scripts, which set up the base Ubuntu servers with all required tools.
